# Introduction

This Laravel package eases [PHP Domain Parser](https://github.com/jeremykendall/php-domain-parser) _(PDP)_ integration in your Laravel application.

PHP Domain Parser is a resource based domain parser implemented in PHP. With it you can easily parse a domain into its component subdomain, registrable domain, second level domain and public suffix parts using the Public Suffix List or IANA Top Level Domain List.

This package doesn't intent to replace or reinvent the API offered by PDP, instead it offers you various entry points to PDP which can be used to validate or process your domain.
